It works by constructing a search tree incrementally while exploring the decision space through simulations (i.e., randomly selecting actions to play out), and using the results of the simulations to guide further search. It has been used to solve a variety of problems, including game-playing (e.g., AlphaGo), resource allocation, and robotic motion planning.\n",

The Node class is used to define the nodes in the MCTS tree, which have a state, a number of visits, a total reward, a set of children, and a parent. The MCTS class defines the MCTS algorithm, which has a selection function, an expansion function, a simulation function, and a backpropagation function. Finally, the initial_state variable defines the initial state for the MCTS algorithm.\n",

We then call the gp_minimize function to perform Bayesian optimization with a specified number of function evaluations (n_calls). Finally, we print the best parameters and objective function value found, and plot the convergence of the optimization over iterations using plot_convergence.\n",
